# Pneumonia-Classifier
This file proposes a convolutional neural network model trained from scratch to classify and detect the presence of pneumonia from a collection of chest X-ray image samples.
I have constructed a convolutional neural network model from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia.
This model could help mitigate the reliability and interpretability challenges often faced when dealing with medical imagery.
